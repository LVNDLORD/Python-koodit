# 2. Variables and interactive programs

# 1) Write a program that asks your name and then greets you by your name: Examples:
#
# If you enter Viivi as your name, the program will greet you with Hello, Viivi!.
# If you enter Ahmed as your name, the program will greet you with Hello, Ahmed!.

# 2) Write a program that asks the user for the radius of a circle and the prints out the area of the circle.
#
# 3) Write a program that asks the user for the length and width of a rectangle. The program then prints out the perimeter and area of the rectangle.
# The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of each four sides.
#
# 4) Write a program that asks the user for three integer numbers. The program prints out the sum, product, and average of the numbers.
#
# 5) Write a program that asks the user to enter a mass in medieval units:
# talents (leivisk√§), pounds (naula), and lots (luoti).
# The program converts the input to full kilograms and grams and outputs the result to the user:
#
# One talent is 20 pounds.
# One pound is 32 lots.
# One lot is 13,3 grams.

rectangle_width = float(input("Enter width: "))
print(f"The perimeter of the rectangle is: {round(rectangle_width + rectangle_length, 2)}")

# 4
